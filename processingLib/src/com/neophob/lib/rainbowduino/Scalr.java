/**
 * Class used to implement performant, good-quality and intelligent image
 * scaling algorithms in native Java. This class utilizes the Java2D
 * "best practices" for image-scaling, ensuring that images are hardware
 * accelerated at all times if provided by the platform and host-VM.
 * <p/>
 * All scaling operations implemented by this class maintain the proportion of
 * the original image. If image-cropping is desired the caller will need to
 * perform those edits before calling one of the <code>resize</code> methods
 * provided by this class.
 * <p/>
 * This class implements a few different methods for scaling an image, providing
 * either the best-looking result or the fastest result depending on the scaling
 * hint provided (see {@link Method}).
 * <p/>
 * This class also implements the incremental scaling algorithm presented by
 * Chris Campbell in his <a href="http://today.java
 * .net/pub/a/today/2007/04/03/perils-of-image-getscaledinstance.html">Perils of
 * Image.getScaledInstance()</a> article in order to give the best-looking
 * results to images scaled down below roughly 800px in size where using a
 * single scaling operation (even with
 * {@link RenderingHints#VALUE_INTERPOLATION_BICUBIC} interpolation) would
 * produce a much worse-looking result.
 * <p/>
 * Minor modifications are made to Campbell's original implementation in the
 * form of:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Instead of accepting a user-supplied interpolation method,
 * {@link RenderingHints#VALUE_INTERPOLATION_BICUBIC} interpolation is always
 * used. This was done after A/B comparison testing with large images
 * down-scaled to thumbnail sizes showed noticeable "blurring" when BILINEAR
 * interpolation was used. Given that Campbell's algorithm is only used in
 * QUALITY mode when down-scaling, it was determined that the user's expectation
 * of a much less blurry picture would require that BICUBIC be the default
 * interpolation in order to meet the QUALITY expectation.</li>
 * <li>After each iteration of the do-while loop that incrementally scales the
 * source image down, an effort is made to explicitly call
 * {@link BufferedImage#flush()} on the interim temporary {@link BufferedImage}
 * instances created by the algorithm in an attempt to ensure a more complete GC
 * cycle by the VM when cleaning up the temporary instances.</li>
 * <li>Extensive comments have been added to increase readability of the code.</li>
 * <li>Variable names have been expanded to increase readability of the code.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>NOTE</strong>: This class does not call {@link BufferedImage#flush()}
 * on any of the source images passed in by calling code; it is up to the
 * original caller to dispose of their source images when they are no longer
 * needed so the VM can most efficiently GC them.
